# Bruin Racing M21 Simscape Model
*project urban-fiesta*

I'm fucking hammered so sorry if this documentation doesn't make sense.

# Project Scope

This model is adapted from a [Mathworks tutorial](https://www.mathworks.com/videos/modeling-a-vehicle-with-continuously-variable-transmission-1554467867519.html?s_tid=srchtitle) on modeling CVT modeling with Simscape. It is intended for basic tuning insight while vehicle data is unavailable due to COVID-19.
